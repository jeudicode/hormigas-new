# Bio

I'm a Master's student of biology, environmental education and geography with further focus on education. Besides these main interests of mine I like to explore the hidden mysteries behind how this world's nature works. I enjoy spending time in nature, especially mountains, finding species that are unique to that area and discovering how some species may affect others.
