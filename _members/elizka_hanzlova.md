# Bio

I'm a Master's student of biology, environmental education and geography with further focus on education. Besides these main interests of mine I like to explore the hidden mysteries behind how this world's nature works. I enjoy spending time in nature, especially mountains, finding species that are unique to that area and discovering how some species may affect others.

Thesis
* Characteristics of plant-ant relationships in Melanesia
   The aim of this work is to revise the relationships between ant and plant species in the Melanesian region. We do not yet have a comprehensive dataset for New Guinea that has been updated and critically revised. I will create a new dataset of information on ant-plant interactions in Melanesia, based on unpublished and published data, and analyse the basic ecological parameters of these interactions. By understanding the mechanisms underlying these relationships, we can better understand the functioning of the whole ecosystem and thus better protect it.
