# Bio

I’m interested in ecology, evolution and distribution of ants and am currently studying the diversity of the genus Odontomachus in New Guinea. I also document my antkeeping journey on my <a href="https://linktr.ee/antsczech">YouTube channel</a>.

# Research project
Diversity and description of new species of ants of the genus Odontomachus (Latreille) of New Guinea
According to current knowledge, the ant genus Odontomachus is represented in New Guinea in 17 species. However, the world's second largest island harbours more species in its diverse habitats, which have been revealed by the preliminary phylogenetic analysis.
In the practical part, the results of the phylogenetic analysis will be confirmed or refuted using morphometric techniques based on the measurement of predefined dimensions in all individuals. The resulting data will be subjected to appropriate statistical analysis and the expected new species will be described.
