# Bio

I am especially interested in the taxonomy, behavior and distribution of ants. My research focuses on urban, introduced and invasive ants. I mainly analyze the biology and natural history of these ants, as well as their pathways of introduction and establishment potential, to detect ants that have not yet entered Mexico and may present a risk, in addition to studying the exotic ants that are already present in Mexican territory but has not yet revealed its invasion potential. I am also interested in ants that inhabit different agroecosystems and their different ecological functions.
In our laboratory, we collaborate in the taxonomic identification of native and non-native ant species, the curing of the ant collection in Mexico, the participation in the monitoring of exotic species in Mexico, the evaluation of the effects on native diversity, the ecology and species distribution studies, participation in data analysis, preparation of reports on invasive species with high risk for Mexico, highlighting information on origin, distribution, biology, management and impacts on biodiversity, human and economic health.
