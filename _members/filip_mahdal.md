# Thesis

* Diversity and biogegraphic affinity of insects along an altitudial gradient

Although the diversity of organisms on Earth is one of the most important manifestations of living nature, it is still insufficiently explored. Its meaning remains in the preservation of life on on Earth and as far as the world of insects is concerned, this diversity is truly enormous, especially in tropical regions.

In the theoretical part, this diploma thesis will deal with key knowledge about biodiversity and the methods of its calculation in the given territory. We will get to know each other here with a description of the insects living in the studied area, the effect of the height gradient on the studied area, and the zoogeographic areas to which the studied species will be described.
 
The practical part will deal with the affinity of butterflies (Lepidoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) to different geographical areas from Arizona to Mexico, their relation to altitude gradient and possibility of origin within the zoogeographic area. A key part of this work was to describe the diversity of the investigated species. Diversity was explored using a new a method called DNAbarcoding, which consists of molecular identification based on comparing the sequences of nuclear or mitochondrial genes and subsequent identification of unknown species.
